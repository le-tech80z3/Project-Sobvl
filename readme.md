# SvySobvl

This project takes a common problem, not having a platform to sync and store voice memos, and provides an intuitive user friendly design to bring spontaneous ideas to life in a todo app.

### The technology implemented includes:
     
     * React
     *  AWS
     * Express
     * Node.js
     * MongoDb Atlas
     * Sass
     * Oauth

### Features

MVP site registers new user then clicking on optional Add Xipsolos or "playlists" will take user to its show page where the user will see data associated with the Xipsolo. User can create names and labels that describe the content the Xipsolos hold. 

As the data, the voice files or "xips" are able to play as well as allow user input that describe the contents of the memo.

### Challenges 

The files in this project were not added to a route due to some setbacks in terms of a timeline, I set up a solid structure to implement the upload feature later on.
